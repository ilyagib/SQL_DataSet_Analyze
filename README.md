# SQL_DataSet_Analyze
This project demonstrates my proficiency in SQL for data extraction and business intelligence. Using a relational database of an e-commerce platform, I authored complex queries to solve real-world business questions.

Key Technical Skills Demonstrated:

Advanced Aggregations: Calculating totals, averages, and counts across various dimensions.

Joins & Relationships: Connecting multiple tables (Orders, Sessions, Products, Refunds) to gain a holistic view of the customer journey.

Window Functions: Using RANK() and OVER(PARTITION BY...) to identify top-performing traffic sources.

Data Filtering & Grouping: Utilizing HAVING and WHERE clauses for specific time-frame and performance benchmarks.

Subqueries & CTEs: Structuring readable and efficient code using Common Table Expressions.

Business Insights Extracted:

Identifying the most effective referral websites for specific device types.

Analyzing product performance through sales volume vs. refund rates.

Monitoring website traffic trends by page and date.
